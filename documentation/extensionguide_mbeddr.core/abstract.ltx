The mbeddr approach to embedded development is based on modular, incrementalextension of the C programming language using the MPS language workbench. Thispaper provides an overview over how to extend the language. The paper assumes abasic familiarity with MPS and some familiarity with \emph{using} the mbeddr Clanguage, e.g. as explained in the user's guide. The paper outlines a set ofchallenges in embedded software development and then shows examples how mbeddrextensions of C can address those challenges. The main section of the paper thenshows how to build such extensions.
