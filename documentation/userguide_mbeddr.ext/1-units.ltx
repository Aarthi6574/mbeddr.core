\section{Physical Units}



Physical Units are new types that, in
addition to specifying their actual data type, also specify a physical unit (see
\fig{unitsexample}). New literals are introduced to support specifying
values for these types that include the physical unit. The typing rules for the
existing operators (\ic{+}, \ic{*} or \ic{>}) are overridden to perform the
correct type checks for types with units. The type system also performs unit
computations to, for example, handle an \ic{speed = length/time} correctly.

\caption{The \emph{units} extension comes with the sevel SI units predefined and
lets users define arbitrary derived units (such as the \ic{mps} in the example).
It is also possible to defined convertible units that require a numeric
conversion factor to get back to SI units. Type checks ensure that the values
associated with unit literals use the correct unit and perform unit computations
(as in speed equals length divided by time). Errors are recorded if
incompatible are used together (e.g. if we were to add length and time). To
support this feature, the typing rules for the existing operators (such as
\ic{+} or \ic{/}) have to be overridden.}
