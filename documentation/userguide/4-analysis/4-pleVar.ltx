\section{Checking Product Line Variability}

\subsection{Installation}

Checking the consistency of feature models and configurations is based on the Yices SMT solver:\\
\ic{http://yices.csl.sri.com/download.shtml}

To be able to use these analyses, the solver has to be installed on your machine
and available in the search path.

\subsection{Available Analyses}

For feature models we can check if the cross-cutting constraints are consistent or not. 
If the cross-cutting constraints are not consistent, then the feature model cannot be 
instantiated (\ie no valid configuration is possible). In the case of configuration models 
we provide analyses if they conform to the defined feature model.

\subsection{Performing the Analyses}

The first step for analyzing decision tables is to add the devkit
\ic{com.mbeddr.analyses.fm} to the model that contains the feature model.

\end{center}

Once the devkit is added to the model, you can mark a feature model or a
configuration model as \ic{verifiable} by using an intention. Once the \ic{verifiable} 
flag is set it will be displayed on the top of the feature model or configuration model.

To start the verification, right-click on the feature model node and select the 
'Verify Feature Model' menu.

\end{center} 

Following the "verify" action, the result will be displayed in a window as shown below. 
In the case when the feature model is inconsistent (since it contains constraints that are
conflicting with each other), the conflicting constraints are listed.

To start the verification, right-click on the feature model node and select the 
'Verify Configuration Model' menu.

\end{center}

The result of the verification is displayed in a window as a debug information about 
which of the features selected in the configuration are conflicting with the constraints 
defined in the  feature model.
