\chapter{Tutorial}
\label{tutorial}
  
This tutorial assumes that you have successfully run through the Hello World
tutorial in \sect{helloworld}. If you haven't, you can use one of the Wizards in
the \ic{Code} menu to create a \ic{Minimal Test Case}. From this, the starting
point for our tutorial looks as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item We have a default type size configuration.
  \item We have a build configuration with one \ic{Executable}.
  \item We have an \ic{ImplementationModule} with a \ic{main} function.
\end{itemize}
