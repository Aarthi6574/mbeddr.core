\section{State Machines}

Next to components and units, state machines are one of the main C extensions
available in mbeddr. They can be used directly in C programs, or alternatively,
embedded into components. To keep the overall complexity of the example
manageable, we will show state machine use directly in C.

To use state machines, the respective model has to use the
\ic{com.mbeddr.statemachines} devkit. We then create a new module
\ic{StateMachines} and add it to the build configuration. We can also create a
test case and call it from \ic{Main} (there is an intention on the \ic{test}
expression that automatically adds all test cases that are visible).
