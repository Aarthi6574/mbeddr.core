\section{Checking Interface Contracts}

\subsection{Installation}

Checking the contracts attached to component interfaces is based on the
CBMC model checker:\\
\ic{http://www.cprover.org/cbmc/}

To be able to use these analyses, CBMC has to be installed on your machine
and available in the search path.


\subsection{Available Analyses}

Given an interface with operations annotated with pre-/postconditions, we can 
check for all runnables of components implementing the interface operations:

\begin{itemize}
\item that when they are called the preconditions are ensured to hold;
\item that the postconditions attached to runnables hold when they return.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performing the Analyses}

The first step for analyzing pre-/postconditions is to enable the generation of 
labels in the \ic{Build Configuration}:

\end{center}

To start the verification, right-click on a component node and select the \ic{Verify pre/post with CBMC} menu item.
\begin{center}

\end{center} 

The verification result will be displayed in a window as shown below.
On the upper part of the window we have the list with checked assertions and runnables. 
In the case when an assertion fails, if you double-click on it then a trace through the system that leads to 
the failure will be displayed in the loper part of the window.
