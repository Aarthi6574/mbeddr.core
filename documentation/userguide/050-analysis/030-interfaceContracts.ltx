\section{Checking Interface Contracts and Protocols}

\subsection{Installation}

Checking the contracts and protocols attached to component interfaces is based on the
CBMC model checker:\\
\ic{http://www.cprover.org/cbmc/}

To be able to use these analyses, CBMC has to be installed on your machine
and available in the search path.


\subsection{Available Analyses}

Given an interface with operations annotated with pre-/postconditions or interface 
usage protocols, we can check for all runnables of components implementing the 
interface operations:

\begin{itemize}
\item that when they are called the preconditions are ensured to hold;
\item that the postconditions attached to runnables hold when they return.
\item that the clients of this component comply with the protocol expected by the interface.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performing the Analyses}

The first step for analyzing pre-/postconditions and interface protocols is to enable the generation of 
labels in the \ic{Build Configuration}:

\end{center}

To start the verification, right-click on a component node and select the \ic{Verify component with CBMC} menu item.
\begin{center}

\end{center} 

The verification result will be displayed in a window as shown below.
On the upper part of the window we have the list with checked pre-/postconditions and protocols. 
In the case when an condition fails, if you double-click on it then a trace through the system that leads to 
the failure will be displayed in the loper part of the window. Many times traces are long and can be 
filtered by entering a text. By clicking the "Call/Return" only the method calls and returns from the 
counterexample will be displayed. By selecting "Last 100" only the last 100 steps of the counterexample
will be displayed.

\subsection{Analyses Configuration}

For each component one can configure how the analysis is performed by defining an analysis configuration. 
The following parameters can be configured:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf entry point} represents the function from where the analysis starts. By default, if none is given, the 
analysis starts from the \ic{main} function.
\item {\bf loops unwinding} is the number of times the loops are unwinded (unfolded)
\item {\bf unwinding assertions} when set \ic{true} then the analysis fails if the number of unfolds is insufficient 
for analyzing the whole loop. If set to false, then the analysis is performed but potentially incomplete.
\end{itemize}

The analysis configuration can be created in two ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf 1)} in the inspector of the 'verifiable' flag.
\item {\bf 2)} as item in an 'Analysis Configuration' module. By right-clicking on the \ic{Analysis configuration} node,
all analyses are performed.
\end{itemize}
