mbeddr is a extensible, C-based programming environment optimized for embedded
programming based on JetBrains MPS. This document describes the mbeddr stack
from a user's perspective. It guides through the installation process of
mbeddr, provides a simple "hello world" tutorial and discusses the
differences to regular C. It also discusses all the extensions that are open
sourced so far, including components, state machines, exceptions, physical
units, requirements tracing and product line variability.
