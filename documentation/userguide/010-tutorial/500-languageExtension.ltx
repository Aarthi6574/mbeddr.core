\chapter{Extending mbeddr}

This chapter discusses the \emph{extension} of the mbeddr system by developing
new languages or extending C. The chapter is essentially a collection of various
example languages that each explain different aspects; there is also some
overlap, i.e. some things may be explained more than once. 

This chapter is not intended as a complete MPS tutorial, although, of course, by
explaining how to build mbeddr extensions, we implicitly explain MPS. However,
we do recommend to take a look at some of the tutorials on the MPS website. In
particular, we recommend reading the LWC11 tutorial at

We also recommend reading a paper that explains the various
approaches for language composition:

The latter paper is also available as a set of narrated screencasts. Please
watch them in this order:
