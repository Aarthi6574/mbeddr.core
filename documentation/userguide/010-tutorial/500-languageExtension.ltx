\chapter{Extending mbeddr}

This chapter discusses the \emph{extension} of the mbeddr system by developing
new languages or extending C. The chapter is essentially a collection of various
example languages that each explain different aspects; there is also some
overlap, i.e. some things may be explained more than once. 

This chapter is not intended as a complete MPS tutorial, although, of course, by
explaining how to build mbeddr extensions, we implicitly explain MPS. However,
we do recommend to take a look at some of the tutorials on the MPS website. In
particular, we recommend reading the LWC11 tutorial at

\ \ \ \ic{http://code.google.com/p/mps-lwc11/wiki/GettingStarted}

We also recommend reading a paper that explains the various
approaches for language composition:

The latter paper is also available as a set of narrated screencasts. Please
watch them in this order:

This chapter consists of several sections. Each of them explain various aspects
of mbeddr language extensions. While the different sections look as if they
could be read separately because they cover different examples, they do in fact
build on each other: later sections do not repeat explanations for things
explained in earlier sections. So we suggest you read through the whole chapter,
beginning to end.
 
We also recommend you open the the actual example project and explore the code
as you read the tutorials. Especially in the later sections we don't discuss
every detail in the tutorial text.
