# In simpler words...

In simple terms, the project utilizes [**mbeddr**](http://mbeddr.wordpress.com/)'s higher level concepts (like statemachines and components) along with [**AF3**](http://af3.fortiss.org/)'s versatility plus some physical components (a [**hardware Pacer**](http://wiki.cas.mcmaster.ca/index.php/Pacemaker_Hardware_Reference_Platform_Details) developed by some folks from the University of Minnesota, a [**BeagleBone Rev. A5 board**](http://beagleboard.org/static/beaglebone/latest/README.htm) and a [**BeagleBone LCD Rev. A1 display**](http://beagleboardtoys.com/wiki/index.php?title=BeagleBone_LCD7)) along with some 'glue' tools to try to develop a simple yet fully running pacemaker as described by [Boston's 2007 challenge specs](http://sqrl.mcmaster.ca/_SQRLDocuments/PACEMAKER.pdf).

## The outcome? **It's doable!**

# Project directory structure
- - -
There are only 2 directories that are present in the project :

 *  The '**doc**' folder - which contains further documentation regarding the project
 *  _and_ the '**src**' folder - in which the project sources (3 subdirectories for each environment : 2 for PIC and 1 for BeagleBone) reside.

# Whereto now?
- - -
If you want to reproduce our result, we highly recommend reading the doc's folder.

## Good luck!
